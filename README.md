# Text-Based Game in Smalltalk, Haskell, and Prolog

## Overview

This repository contains simple text-based games developed as part of the _Programming Paradigms_ course. The aim of the project is to explore different programming paradigms through implementation in the following languages:

- **Smalltalk** (Object-Oriented Paradigm)
- **Haskell** (Functional Paradigm)
- **Prolog** (Logic Paradigm)

Each language showcases a unique paradigm and demonstrates how the same type of problem—building a text-based game—can be approached in fundamentally different ways.
